SENSE OF CONGRESS OPPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON THE EXPORT OF \n              CRUDE OIL OR OTHER PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has enjoyed a renaissance in energy \n        production, with the expansion of domestic crude oil and other \n        petroleum product production contributing to enhanced energy \n        security and significant economic benefits to the national \n        economy.\n            (2) In 2015, Congress recognized the need to adapt to \n        changing crude oil market conditions and repealed all \n        restrictions on the export of crude oil on a bipartisan basis.\n            (3) Section 101 of title I of division O of the \n        Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (42 U.S.C. 6212a) \n        established the national policy on oil export restriction, \n        prohibiting any official of the Federal Government from \n        imposing or enforcing any restrictions on the export of crude \n        oil with limited exceptions, including a savings clause \n        maintaining the authority to prohibit exports under any \n        provision of law that imposes sanctions on a foreign person or \n        foreign government (including any provision of law that \n        prohibits or restricts United States persons from engaging in a \n        transaction with a sanctioned person or government), including \n        a foreign government that is designated as a state sponsor of \n        terrorism.\n            (4) Lifting the restrictions on crude oil exports \n        encouraged additional domestic energy production, created \n        American jobs and economic development, and allowed the United \n        States to emerge as the leading oil producer in the world.\n            (5) In 2019, the United States became a net exporter of \n        petroleum products for the first time since 1952, and the \n        reliance of the United States on foreign imports of petroleum \n        products has declined to historic lows.\n            (6) Free trade, open markets, and competition have \n        contributed to the rise of the United States as a global energy \n        superpower.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nFederal Government should not impose--\n            (1) overly restrictive regulations on the exploration, \n        production, or marketing of energy resources; or\n            (2) any restrictions on the export of crude oil or other \n        petroleum products under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \n        (42 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.), except with respect to the export of \n        crude oil or other petroleum products to a foreign person or \n        foreign government subject to sanctions under any provision of \n        United States law, including to a country the government of \n        which is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\nSEC. 10007.
