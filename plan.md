# Legislative Lens Development Plan

## Project Overview
Legislative Lens is a React application for exploring and analyzing legislative data from Congress.gov. The application provides a user-friendly interface for viewing bills, tracking their progress, and exploring member and committee information.

## Tech Stack
- React with TypeScript
- Chakra UI for components and styling
- Axios for API requests
- React Router for navigation

## Core Features
1. Bill Search and Viewing
2. Bill Progress Tracking
3. Member Information
4. Committee Information
5. Timeline Visualization

## Implementation Phases
1. Frontend Mockup (Current)
2. API Integration
3. State Management
4. Testing and Polish

## Current Focus: Frontend Mockup
Creating a polished frontend mockup using static data to demonstrate the UI/UX before implementing real API integration.

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Create static data files for bills, members, and committees
- [x] Set up static data service for accessing mock data
- [x] Update BillSummary component with loading skeletons and enhanced UI
- [x] Update MemberCard component with loading skeletons and enhanced UI
- [x] Update CommitteeModal component with loading skeletons and enhanced UI

### Recent Progress
- Enhanced CommitteeModal component with:
  - Loading skeletons for all content areas
  - Error and "not found" states with clear feedback
  - Member photos/avatars for leadership
  - Responsive grid layout
  - Hover effects and transitions
  - Consistent color scheme using Chakra's color mode values

  - External links to official websites

### Next Steps
1. Update Timeline component:
   - Add loading skeletons
   - Implement error states
   - Enhance visual design
   - Add interactive features
   - Ensure responsive layout

2. Final Polish:
   - Review and refine all component interactions
   - Ensure consistent styling across components
   - Add any missing loading states
   - Verify responsive behavior
   - Document component usage

## Success Criteria
- [x] All components use static data service
- [x] Loading states implemented for all components
- [x] Error handling in place
- [x] Responsive design working
- [ ] Timeline component updated
- [ ] Final polish complete
