Build a web application that helps users explore and understand U.S. Congressional activity. The app should:

Core Experience:
1. Present a clean, single-screen interface divided into:
   - Bill tracking (timeline, status, details)
   - Geographic representation (interactive map showing votes and representatives)
   - Daily activity highlights
   - Quick access to saved items

2. Enable users to:
   - Track bills through their legislative journey
   - Find and learn about their representatives
   - Understand voting patterns
   - Save items for later reference

Visual Design:
- Modern, professional aesthetic
- Clear information hierarchy
- Responsive design that adapts gracefully to all devices
- Intuitive navigation and interaction patterns

Key Features:
- Interactive timeline showing a bill's progress
- US map visualization with:
  - Vote distribution patterns
  - Representative selection
  - State/district highlighting
- Rich member profiles including:
  - Voting history
  - Committee assignments
  - Contact information
- Comprehensive search across bills, members, and committees
- Daily highlights of significant legislative activity
- Quick access to saved/pinned items

The interface should be immediately useful with sample data, with architecture ready for real API integration later.
